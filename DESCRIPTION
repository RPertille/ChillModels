Description: This package contains functions for calculate the chilling and heat acumulate for studies in the temperate fruit trees. The models in this package are: Utah (Richardson et al., 1974), Positive Chill Units - PCU (Utah modified by Infruitec), GDH_A (Growing Degree Hours by Anderson et al., 1986), GDH_R (Growing Degree Hours by Richardon, 1974), North Carolina (Shaltout e Unrath, 1983), Landsberg Model, Q10 Model (Bidabe), Model by Jones et al. (2013), Low-Chill Model (Gilreath and Buchanan, 1981), Model for Cherry "Sweetheart" (Guak and Nielsen, 2013), Model for apple "Gala" (Guak and Nielsen, 2013), Dinamic Model (Fichmann, 1987) adapted of the "chillR - 0.70.6" package (Eike Luedeling, 2018), and Unified Model (Isabela Chuine et al. 2016).
