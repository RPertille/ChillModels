 - PCU (Utah modified by Infruitec)  
 - GDH_A (Growing Degree Hours by Anderson et al., 1986)  
 - GDH_A (Growing Degree Hours by Richardon, 1974)  
 - North Carolina (Shaltout e Unrath, 1983)  
 - Landsberg Model, Q10 Model (Bidabe)  
 - Model by Jones et al. (2013)  
 - Low-Chill Model (Gilreath and Buchanan, 1981)  
 - Model for Cherry "Sweetheart" (Guak and Nielsen, 2013)  
 - Model for apple "Gala" (Guak and Nielsen, 2013)  
 - Dynamic Model (Fichmann, 1987) adapted of the "chillR" package  
 - Unified Model of Chuine (Chuine, I. et al. 2016)
