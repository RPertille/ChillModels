\title{Unified Model}
\usage{
unified_model(x, total = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector containing temperature values (Celsius-degree).}

\item{total}{TRUE Shows the total value of accumulation, FALSE shows the value of chill-unit for each temperature (TRUE is default).}
}
\value{
The function returns values the chill-units for each temperature of vector (Total = FALSE), or returns the chill-units accumulation (Total = TRUE).
}
\description{
Quantifies the chill accumulation rates by means of converting temperatures to chill-units.
}
\details{
The coefficients used in this model are adjusted for the apple tree.The model is based on chill-units, but the limits are unknown.
}
\examples{

x <- rnorm(500,10,3)
unified_model(x)
unified_model(x, FALSE)
