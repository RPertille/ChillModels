\title{Positive Chill Units - PCU}
\usage{
pcu_model(x, total = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector containing temperature values (Celsius-degree).}

\item{total}{TRUE Shows the total value of accumulation, FALSE shows the value of chill-unit for each temperature (TRUE is default).}
}
\value{
The function returns values the chill-units for each temperature of vector.
}
\description{
Quantifies the chill and heat accumulation rates by means of converting temperatures to positive chill-units - Modified Utah Model.
}
\details{
The PCU Model is the modified Utah Model. When the temperature is above 15.9Â°C, the chill-unit is 0. This modification was made because when the Utah model is applied in warm conditions, accumulation becomes negative.
